# # Run OpenAI-compatible LLM inference with Qwen3-8B and vLLM

# LLMs do more than just model language: they chat, they produce JSON and XML, they run code, and more.
# This has complicated their interface far beyond "text-in, text-out".
# OpenAI's API has emerged as a standard for that interface,
# and it is supported by open source LLM serving frameworks like [vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/).

# In this example, we show how to run a vLLM server in OpenAI-compatible mode on Modal.

# Our examples repository also includes scripts for running clients and load-testing for OpenAI-compatible APIs
# [here](https://github.com/modal-labs/modal-examples/tree/main/06_gpu_and_ml/llm-serving/openai_compatible).

# You can find a (somewhat out-of-date) video walkthrough of this example and the related scripts on the Modal YouTube channel
# [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmY_7ePR1hM).

# ## Set up the container image

# Our first order of business is to define the environment our server will run in:
# the [container `Image`](https://modal.com/docs/guide/custom-container).
# vLLM can be installed with `pip`, since Modal [provides the CUDA drivers](https://modal.com/docs/guide/cuda).

vllm_image = (
    modal.Image.from_registry("nvidia/cuda:12.8.0-devel-ubuntu22.04", add_python="3.12")
    .entrypoint([])
    .uv_pip_install(
        "vllm==0.11.2",
        "huggingface-hub==0.36.0",
        "flashinfer-python==0.5.2",
        "bitsandbytes==0.49.1",
    )
    .env({"HF_XET_HIGH_PERFORMANCE": "1"})  # faster model transfers
)

# ## Download the model weights

# We'll be running a pretrained foundation model -- Qwen's Qwen3-8B.
# It is trained with reasoning capabilities, which allow it to
# enhance the quality of its generated responses.

# We'll use an FP8 (eight-bit floating-point) post-training-quantized variant: Qwen/Qwen3-8B-FP8.
# Native hardware support for FP8 formats in [Tensor Cores](https://modal.com/gpu-glossary/device-hardware/tensor-core)
# is limited to the latest [Streaming Multiprocessor architectures](https://modal.com/gpu-glossary/device-hardware/streaming-multiprocessor-architecture),
# like those of Modal's [Hopper H100/H200 and Blackwell B200 GPUs](https://modal.com/blog/announcing-h200-b200).

# You can swap this model out for another by changing the strings below.
# A single H100 GPU has enough VRAM to store an 8,000,000,000 parameter model,
# like Qwen3-8B, in eight bit precision, along with a very large KV cache.


# MODEL_NAME = "Qwen/Qwen3-VL-2B-Instruct"
MODEL_NAME = "VishwanathAS/Qwen3-VLA-Driver-base"
# MODEL_REVISION = "220b46e3b2180893580a4454f21f22d3ebb187d3"  # avoid nasty surprises when repos update!

# Although vLLM will download weights from Hugging Face on-demand,
# we want to cache them so we don't do it every time our server starts.
# We'll use [Modal Volumes](https://modal.com/docs/guide/volumes) for our cache.
# Modal Volumes are essentially a "shared disk" that all Modal Functions can access like it's a regular disk. For more on storing model weights on Modal, see
# [this guide](https://modal.com/docs/guide/model-weights).


hf_cache_vol = modal.Volume.from_name("huggingface-cache", create_if_missing=True)

# We'll also cache some of vLLM's JIT compilation artifacts in a Modal Volume.

vllm_cache_vol = modal.Volume.from_name("vllm-cache", create_if_missing=True)

# ## Configuring vLLM

# ### Trading off fast boots and token generation performance

# vLLM has embraced dynamic and just-in-time compilation to eke out additional performance without having to write too many custom kernels,
# e.g. via the Torch compiler and CUDA graph capture.
# These compilation features incur latency at startup in exchange for lowered latency and higher throughput during generation.
# We make this trade-off controllable with the `FAST_BOOT` variable below.

FAST_BOOT = True

# If you're running an LLM service that frequently scales from 0 (frequent ["cold starts"](https://modal.com/docs/guide/cold-start))
# then you'll want to set this to `True`.

# If you're running an LLM service that usually has multiple replicas running, then set this to `False` for improved performance.

# See the code below for details on the parameters that `FAST_BOOT` controls.

# For more on the performance you can expect when serving your own LLMs, see
# [our LLM engine performance benchmarks](https://modal.com/llm-almanac).

# ## Build a vLLM engine and serve it

# The function below spawns a vLLM instance listening at port 8000, serving requests to our model.
# We wrap it in the [`@modal.web_server` decorator](https://modal.com/docs/guide/webhooks#non-asgi-web-servers)
# to connect it to the Internet.

# The server runs in an independent process, via `subprocess.Popen`, and only starts accepting requests
# once the model is spun up and the `serve` function returns.

# ## Deploy the server

# To deploy the API on Modal, just run
# ```bash
# modal deploy vllm_inference.py
# ```

# This will create a new app on Modal, build the container image for it if it hasn't been built yet,
# and deploy the app.

# ## Interact with the server

# Once it is deployed, you'll see a URL appear in the command line,
# something like `https://your-workspace-name--example-vllm-inference-serve.modal.run`.

# You can find [interactive Swagger UI docs](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/)
# at the `/docs` route of that URL, i.e. `https://your-workspace-name--example-vllm-inference-serve.modal.run/docs`.
# These docs describe each route and indicate the expected input and output
# and translate requests into `curl` commands.

# For simple routes like `/health`, which checks whether the server is responding,
# you can even send a request directly from the docs.
